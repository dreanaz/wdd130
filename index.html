                <p>Hi, my name is Dreana and I am from Punalu'u, O'ahu. My little family and I like to camp simply on a private beach.  We bring a tarp for us to sleep under if it rains but, if it's a clear night then we like to sleep under the stars! This is my practice page as I develop skills as a software developer through BYU-Idaho. This will be a live journal to show what I am learning. I hope to use these skills to help people be the best version of themselves and promote healthy relationships. </p>
